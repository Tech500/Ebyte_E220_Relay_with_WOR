# Ebyte_E220_Relay_with_WOR
Uses two Ebyte E220-900T30D radio transceivers to control a relay.  WOR is used to wake microcontroller.

Completed coding of Eybteâ€™s E220 radio for remotely switching power to video camera by web browser request.  Asyncwebserver request turns on camera power and starts
countdown timer for a set viewing time.  When web request arrives; WOR (Wake on Radio) awakens deep sleeping ESP32,  relay for camera power energizes. Countdown 
timer expires relay de-engergizes.
